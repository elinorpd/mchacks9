# Mc(Hack)fee Antivirus 2022 - Pan(demic)-Man

This project was built for [McHacks 9 - 2022](https://www.mchacks.ca), a virtual, 36-hour hackathon. Our goal was to learn more about game development, so we created a COVID-themed spoof of the classic arcade game: pac-man. 

Project made with love by [Nathalie](https://github.com/nredick), [Elinor](https://github.com/elinorpd) and [Alex](https://github.com/allu5662).

## Project Description

The game was built using C# on the Unity game development platform, based on a tutorial by Zigorous ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/TKt_VlMn_aA), [Github](https://github.com/zigurous/unity-pacman-tutorial)). 

In our spoof, pac-man is being chased by COVID-19 variants: Alpha (Pink), Beta (Beta), Delta (Orange), and Omicron (Green). We created custom sprites for the game, including the COVID variant "ghosts", face-mask "power pellets", and vaccine syringe and pill "fruits."
